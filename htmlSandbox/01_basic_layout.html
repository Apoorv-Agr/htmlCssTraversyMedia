    <h2>What is DOCTYPE ?</h2>
    <p>The
        < !DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
    </p>
    <p>DOCTYPE -> Tells the browser what type of document it is.</p>
    <p>As browser can read different types of files like XHTML, HTML5, etc...</p>
    <p>The
        < !DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

            It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

            The
            < !DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

                The
                < !DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
    </p>
    <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration:
        <code>< !DOCTYPE html ></code>.

        The HTML document itself begins with < html> and ends with

        </ html>.

        The visible part of the HTML document is between

        < body> and </ body>.
    </p>
